# 06-3D-RPG

Project #6 for ML_MSCH_C220 at Indiana University, created December 8th, 2022

A simple 3D-RPG game. Try to find the targets fast as you can.

Based on the [Kenney Character Assets](https://kenney.itch.io/kenney-character-assets) provided by kenney.nl. The model and animations were compiled in Blender and then imported into Godot.

## Implementation

I include targets, and NPC with dialogue

Also include the stop-watch, which is your score of the game

Created using [Godot 3.5](https://godotengine.org/download)
